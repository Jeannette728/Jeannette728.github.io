        <p>I am a senior at UNC studying business and am set to graduate with my Bachelors degree this December. My relatives have always been apart of the UNC Bear family. My father graduated from UNC in the late 90s with my brother and I now following in his footsteps. My mother has also worked for UNC for over 25 years along with my aunt. We are proud to be Bears! </p>
        <p>In my free time I enjoy spending a lot of time with family and friends, going on new adventures with my dog Bear, watching movies and experimenting with new food recipes.
