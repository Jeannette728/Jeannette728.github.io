    <h2>&lt;Sometimes&gt; New Laughs</h2>
    <p>I found this website randomly a while ago and think it is just a fun way to release stress. It lets you type your feelings then scream them into the void. The screams are different everytime which is why it is funny.</p>

    <h2>Old Laughs</h2>
    <p>This website has all of the memes you could ever ask for. I could (and have) spent hours scrolling and laughing. This is the ultimate meme website and has laughs for every occasion!</p>
